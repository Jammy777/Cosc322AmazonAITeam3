The goal of the heuristic evaluator is to assign a numerical score to a board state—where a positive score indicates that the board is favorable for the given player, and a negative score indicates an advantage for the opponent. The evaluator does this by measuring several key strategic aspects of the board and then combining them with weighted coefficients.

The heuristic evaluation function uses four key factors to assess a board position: Mobility, Territory, Connectivity, and Queen Distance. Mobility measures the difference in the number of legal moves available between the two players, indicating how dynamic or constrained their positions are. Territory evaluates the size of the reachable area each player controls using a flood-fill algorithm, reflecting spatial control on the board. Connectivity counts how many pairs of queens are within a close distance, suggesting how well the queens can support each other. Lastly, Queen Distance calculates the average Manhattan distance between a player’s queens, with lower distances implying better coordination. Together, these factors create a balanced view of both immediate tactical opportunities and longer-term strategic positioning.
